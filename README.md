# ERC721 NFT Lottery Game

Welcome to our innovative blockchain project, combining ERC721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ERC20 tokens, and a lottery mechanism to provide a unique gaming experience.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use ERC721 NFTs called 'Trees'. Each Tree has a specific height (level) that can be increased using ERC20 tokens known as 'WaterBuckets'. Users can participate in a weekly lottery, where the height of their Tree determines the number of tickets they receive. The higher the Tree, the more tickets the holder gets. However, to ensure fairness, the number of tickets increases at a diminishing rate as the height increases.

50% of the revenue generated by the game flows into a lottery pool. Each week, 10% of the lottery pool is won by the lucky draw winners. The remaining revenue is routed to a partnered DeFi project through SushiSwap.

## Key Features

- **ERC721 Trees**: Unique NFTs representing 'Trees' that grow in height.
- **ERC20 WaterBuckets**: Tokens used to increase the height of Trees.
- **Lottery Mechanism**: A fair and decentralized lottery, with odds based on a Tree's height.
- **ReFi Integration**: Half of the revene is used to .

## Lottery

- **Enlist**: you can enlist with any of your tree. Each tree will provide you a specific number of tickets for the lottery, according to it's height and how much he grew recently.
- **Trigger Lottery**: the lottery is fully decentralized so someone has to trigger it. It can only be triggered on Sunday UTC. If not triggered, the lottery continues until next week. When triggered it will designate a winner with a prace ranging randomly between 5 and 15% of the pool. The ensentive to trigger is to reveal the winner.
- **Claim your winnings**: Winner has 48 hours to claim his earnings. After that the next Lottery begins and he won't be able to claim his earnings anymore.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, you need to:

1. Acquire a Tree (ERC721 NFT).
2. Increase its height using WaterBuckets (ERC20 tokens).
3. Participate in the weekly lottery.

## Challenges and Learning

We have faced and overcome several challenges during the development of this project, from integrating with DeFi protocols and setting up SushiSwap routes to creating a fair lottery mechanism and a robust redemption process. It's been an enriching learning experience, and we continue to improve and refine our project.

## Future Improvements

We're working on several enhancements, including better integration with DeFi protocols, enhanced gaming experience, and more efficient lottery and redemption mechanisms. Stay tuned!
